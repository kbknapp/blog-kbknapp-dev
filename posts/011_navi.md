Diving into `navi` as an interactive command builder, and using `strace` as a
demo for concise cheat sheet!

<!-- more -->

In the previous post I spent a short time detailing steps I take to make my
command line experience more pleasant and efficient. One of the steps I listed
was using the tool [`navi`](https://github.com/densidor/navi) to quickly recall
commands.

This is incredibly helpful for commands that I don't use often, or for
variations of commands with specific options that I use less frequently. I find
fuzzy searching through my `navi` cheats is 100x faster than `grep`ping through
Manpages or `--help` output. Now, of course there are times where my `navi`
cheats don't cover something I need and I must fall back to older methods, but
then I just update my cheats and go about my day.

I recently found a new (to me) way to use `navi`, as a "command builder" of
sorts. It makes sense to use on commands where the flags/options are additive,
and not individual commands (which is somewhat of a pet peeve of mine...)

{% fk(after=true, emoji="Â¯\(Â°_o)/Â¯") %}

I should make a post on CLI UX about why certain CLI patterns are sub-optimal...

{% end %}

# Enter `strace`

A good example is `strace`, which allows one to display system calls made by
particular commands and processes. Several other blog posts have recently
mentioned `strace`, and it's a tool that has come in hand for me more than a
couple times so in it's honor it'll be the demo today.

We won't be adding all the options that `strace` has, but the ones I find most
common to my use cases, which probably covers a pretty vast swath of people as
well.

Our goal is to build a `navi` cheat sheet that walks us through building an
`strace` command with all the options we want to expose.

This post won't cover all the details of `strace` or even what all the options
mean, although most of the ones we're adding are pretty self explanatory.

{% fk(after=true, emoji="(á•— Í Â° à¨Š Í Â° )á•—") %}

Like a good CLI should be!

Microscope"](https://blogs.oracle.com/linux/strace-the-sysadmins-microscope-v2).

# `navi` Overview

As mentioned in my previous post, I bind `navi` to `<CTRL>-n` in my terminal,
using the following ZSH function in my `~/.zshrc`:

```sh
_call_navi() {
  local selected
  if selected="$(printf "$(navi --print --path ${HOME}/Projects/navi-cheats/cheats </dev/tty)")"; then
    LBUFFER="$selected"
  fi
  zle redisplay
}

zle -N _call_navi
bindkey '^n' _call_navi
```

The post important parts are the `--path` argument, which tells `navi` to look
in a specific location for cheat sheets (I prefer to use my own directories,
instead of the built in ones and "adding repos" feature). You can add multiple
directories separated via `:` (and technically I have a few directories,
including a `$work` one that I pulled out of the example above).

The path listed above is the `cheats/` directory of [my public
repository](https://github.com/kbknapp/navi-cheats). It's just a big list of
`.cheat` files. More on that soon.

Also the `--print` flag tells `navi` to simply print the final command, instead
of running it. This is useful because often I want to make some additional edits
to the command that either my cheat sheet didn't account for, or the features
simply don't exist to add the flexibility I wanted.

Normally, `--print` would just print the command to `stdout`, however with ZSH
you can have the current command line replaced by the output of a command, which
is what is happening the remainder of the function.

## What is a `.cheat` file?

`navi` looks for files ending in `.cheat` with a particular structure. I won't
re-hash the [entire tutorial from the `navi`
repository](https://github.com/denisidoro/navi/blob/master/docs/cheatsheet_syntax.md)
since it's quite good and comprehensive, but the TL;DR is:

- `.cheat` files can be split up and named however you like, as the file names
  aren't used by `navi`. I tend to use either command names or situations as
  file names.
- Lines starting with `;` are ignored (comments)
- Lines starting with `%` are categories and comma separated key words. These
  make good "tags" when fuzzy matching. I tend to use command names, or
  variations of the names to assist with matching.
- Command descriptions are lines starting with `#` and used as a short
  description of a command
- Commands templates are on the line below a description with no leading
  characters.
  - Commands templates can be multi-line with `\` like regular shell commands
  - **KEY** Commands templates can have "variables" that get expanded *later* if
    the command is selected. Variables are words surrounded by angle brackets
    (i.e. `<foo>`)
- "variable expansions" are optional, but are lines that start with `$` followed
  by the variable name, then `:` followed by the command to expand the variable
  (i.e. the command to present options to user for selection). So our `<foo>`
  variable could have an expansion `$ foo: echo -e "true\nfalse"` which would
  present the two options `true` and `false` to the user using `fzf`, then
  whatever the user selected would replace the `<foo>` in the command template.
- If no variable expansion line is provided, an `fzf` text box is presented to
  the user allowing them to type whatever they want, which will replace the
  variable in the template.
- Files can have as many "categories" as you like
- Multiple command templates can share a single expansion. I.e. think of of a
  bunch of firewall commands, all of which need to allow a user to select a port
  number. All firewall template command could list a `<port>` variable, and the
  file would contain a single `$ port: ...` expansion that applies to all
  templates.
- Beyond functioning as tags, categories separate out variable expansions. So
  variables expansions only apply to command templates within the same category.

So a typical `.cheat` file follows this kind of a pattern:

```

% foo, bar

# Description of command
command -f -b <qux>

# Description of other command
other_command -b -z <bar> <foo>

$ bar: ...
$ foo: ...

```

Again, a single `.cheat` file can have multiple `%` categories, splitting up the
expansions, to allow you to re-use variable names with different concrete
expansions. Although, I *normally* only have a single `%` per file.

## Variable Expansions

This is where the true power of `navi` comes in to play. By default, `navi`
presents a blank `fzf` text box for variables without an expansion line. Such as
the `<qux>` variable above.

So let's first build out our first `strace` `.cheat` file:

```
% strace

# Display system calls for a command
strace <CMD>
```

Running `navi`, and typing something in the fuzzy match area to select our
`strace` command then brings up a new screen asking us to fill in the `CMD`
variable (since we did not provide an expansion). If we type `firefox`, `navi`
drops us back to the terminal with the following command ready to run:

```
$ strace firefox
```

![Fig. 01](../imgs/navi_01.gif)

## Static Expansions

We can present a limited set of options for the user (which by default also
allows them to type something outside of our presented options).

So if we instead add the following line below our command template, we'll get a
list of two options.

```
$ CMD: echo -e 'firefox\ngoogle-chrome'
```

**NOTE:** the user can still type something outside of our two options, although
we can prevent this behavior which we'll see in a minute.

![Fig. 02](../imgs/navi_02.gif)

Since `fzf` by default delimits options via a newline `\n`, we can actually make
the expansion a little more readable using spaces, since the values themselves
don't have any spaces.

```
$ CMD: echo 'firefox google-chrome' | tr ' ' '\n'
```

This is functionally equivalent to what we had before, but some prefer it. It
also points out that expansions can use standard pipes `|`.

Let's add a new command (with description) to our file:

```
% strace

# Display system calls for a command
strace <CMD>

; ðŸ‘‡ is new
# Display system calls for a single PID
strace -p <PID>

$ CMD: echo 'firefox google-chrome' | tr ' ' '\n'
```

Now we can type out a PID we wish to attach `strace` to.

But there is a problem; since we didn't provide an expansion, it's up to us to
type in a valid PID. For example, typing `foo` just blindly makes our command
line:

```
$ strace -p foo
```

![Fig. 03](../imgs/navi_03.gif)

Which will error when run.

Using a static expansion can help with this somewhat:

**NOTE:** on 64bit systems `PID_MAX_LIMIT` is around 4 million...but for
simplicity and demo sake we'll make it the 32bit limit since we'll be changing
it shortly anyways.

```
$ PID: echo {0..32768} | tr ' ' '\n'
```

Which is better, we'll get a *huge* list of numbers (that we can fuzzy match
through). And we'll be dropped on the command line with a PID:

```
$ strace -p 28267
```

But we still have the problem of someone can just type `foo` and again we're in
invalid territory.

![Fig. 04](../imgs/navi_04.gif)

`navi` provides a delimiter we can use on the variable expansions `---` to
provide additional context `navi` either about the selection itself, or
presentation of the options. One such option is `--prevent-extra` which limits
the user to list of options you provided, and nothing more.

**NOTE:** `--prevent-extra` is listed as experimental. And when user provides
something outside the presented list, `navi` exits with an error. I'm on the
fence about if that's better or not. But it's an option no less.

Changing our expansion to the following solves the invalid issue we had before:

```
;                                    ðŸ‘‡ is new
$ PID: echo {0..32768} | tr ' ' '\n' --- --prevent-extra
```

![Fig. 05](../imgs/navi_05.gif)

## Dynamic Expansions

That crazy list of PIDs with no context isn't a ton of help either. Luckily
`navi` can come up with options dynamically!

So instead of just providing 32,000 numbers in sequence, with no process names,
or even knowing if its a valid PID of a current process we can just ask `navi`
to look at the currently running processes via standard shell commands and
present those to the user.

But we have a slight problem, something like `ps -aux` prints out far more
information than we need. We need a PID and a name, more or less.

Since `navi` expansions are just shell pipes, we can use standard utilities like
`grep` and `awk` to fix that!

```
$ PID: ps -aux | grep -v PID | awk '{print $2"    "$11}' --- --prevent-extra
```

We leave the `--prevent-extra` because we're still limited on if the PID isn't
present in this list, well its not valid.

Now we get a nice fuzzy match-able list of PIDs and the associated processes!

However, running this shows one more issue...we get the *whole* selection on our
command line:

```
$ strace -p 3860    /usr/bin/firefox
```

**NOTE:** the extra spaces in there come from our expansion option too!

![Fig. 06](../imgs/navi_06.gif)

`navi` options to the rescue again! There is a `--column` option which allows us
to use only a single column of output as the final selection!

Changing our expansion to:

```
;                                                            ðŸ‘‡ is new
$ PID: ps -aux | grep -v PID | awk '{print $2"    "$11}' --- --column 1 --prevent-extra
```

Gives us the correct output.

```
$ strace -p 3860
```

![Fig. 07](../imgs/navi_07.gif)

Much better!

## Additive Options

Ok, so we can now build an `strace` command, fuzzy match through a valid list of
processes running on our computer, but `strace` provides all kinds of additional
options for us. For example, what we want to suppress `attach/detach` messages
(i.e. `-q`), or it's variations (`-qq` or `-qqq`)?

Turns out, we can use expansions for that too!

Changing our command template slightly, to add a placeholder for the `-q|-qq|-qqq`:

```
# Display system calls for a single PID
strace <QUIET> -p <PID>
```

We can then add another expansion this variable:

```
$ QUIET: echo -e '\t\tNo suppression;-q\t\tSuppress attach/detach messages;-qq\t\tAlso suppress exit statuses;-qqq\t\tSuppress every suppressible message' | tr ';' '\n' --- --column 1
```

We're just building off what we already know. Splitting options into two columns
with the flag we want to add on the left, and description on the right,
separating all options with `;` which we can replace with a newline via `tr`,
then telling `navi` to only use the first column as the actual selected output
for the expansion.

Now we get a new screen asking us if we want to suppress messages or not, with
the associated option on the left!

![Fig. 08](../imgs/navi_08.gif)

**PRO TIP:** It's a good idea to place the "none" or "no" option that represents
no additional flags first, as the user can then just fly through pressing
`<enter>` when they don't wish to add anything additional. This greatly helps
when there are a bunch of optional flags.

One final nicety I like to add is the `--header` option, which allows one to
give a short text describing what the user is actually selecting. This comes in
handy sometimes when the choices aren't super explanatory.

So our final expansion version becomes:

```
$ QUIET: echo -e '\t\tNo suppression;-q\t\tSuppress attach/detach messages;-qq\t\tAlso suppress exit statuses;-qqq\t\tSuppress every suppressible message' | tr ';' '\n' --- --column 1 --header "Suppress any output?"
```

This shows a text message above the input box with description of what `navi` is
asking.

![Fig. 09](../imgs/navi_09.gif)

We can continue fleshing out the options repeating the above steps for the flags
we want to present.

Here is more complete set of expansions:

```
# Display system calls for a command
strace <SUMMARY> <QUIET> <FOLLOW_FORKS> <SYSCALL_TIMES> <SUCCESS_FAILED> <DECODE_FDS> <CMD>
;      ðŸ‘† these variables are new
# Display system calls for a single PID
strace <SUMMARY> <QUIET> <FOLLOW_FORKS> <SYSCALL_TIMES> <SUCCESS_FAILED> <DECODE_FDS> -p <PID>
;      ðŸ‘† these variables are new

$ PID: ps aux | grep -v 'PID' | awk '{print $2"    "$11}' --- --column 1 --header "PID to attach to?"
$ QUIET: echo -e '\t\tNo suppression;-q\t\tSuppress attach/detach messages;-qq\t\tAlso suppress exit statuses;-qqq\t\tSuppress every suppressible message' | tr ';' '\n' --- --column 1 --header "Suppress any output?"

; ðŸ‘‡ These expansions are new
$ TIME_STAMPS: echo -e "-t\t\tabsolute;-tt\t\tabsolute usecs;-ttt\t\tabsolute UNIX time" | tr ';' '\n' --- --column 1 --header "Print Timestamps?"
$ SUMMARY: echo -e "\t\tnone;-c\t\tsummary;-C\t\tsummary only" | tr ';' '\n' --- --column 1 --header "Print Summary?"
$ FOLLOW_FORKS: echo -e "\t\tno;-f\t\tfollow forks;-ff\t\tfollow forks and split output" | tr ';' '\n' --- --column 1 --header "Follow Forks?"
$ SYSCALL_TIMES: echo -e "\t\tno;-T\t\ttime spent in syscalls" | tr ';' '\n' --- --column 1 --header "Display time spent in syscalls?"
$ SUCCESS_FAILED: echo -e "\t\tdon't filter;-z\t\tsuccess only;-Z\t\tfailed only" | tr ';' '\n' --- --column 1 --header "Filter success or failed exits?"
$ DECODE_FDS: echo -e "\t\tno;-yy\t\tdecode all fds" | tr ';' '\n' --- --column 1 --header "Decode File Descriptors?"
```

![Fig. 10](../imgs/navi_10.gif)

Now that we'll have more expansions, you'll notice that in the upper section of
the `navi` window, there is a preview of what expansions have been expanded to
thus var. This comes in handy at times.

![Fig. 11](../imgs/navi_11.jpg)

## Limitations

This brings us to one of the limitations of `navi` (thus far), in that it's
difficult to see if a previous variable has been expanded into something or
another. There is [variable
dependencies](https://github.com/denisidoro/navi/blob/master/docs/cheatsheet_syntax.md#variable-dependency)
but those don't quite do what I want.

A good example is the next (and probably most important) option for `strace` and
that is the filtering.

For example, so see all syscalls related to processes (such as `execve(2)` for
when a process is created), you could use:

```
$ strace -e trace=process ...
```

The `-e` option takes expressions in the form of `option=value`. There are quite
a few predefined options, as well as values, groups, etc.

The way `navi` works now, you can't for example ask, "Do you want to add an
expression" and insert `-e foo=bar` or nothing if they answer no. So we end up
with two different command templates, one with expressions and one without.

Additionally, `navi` is limited to a single expression, you can't for example
loop and provide multiple expressions. `navi` does provide a `--multi` option
which allows FZF to pick multiple options from the list (i.e. imagine multiple
firewall ports), but not multiple pairs in the syntax `strace` expects. This is
normally fine, as you can always add additional expressions after `navi` is
finished, and many times a single expression is all you want anyways.

To get a better sense of this, we'll add two more command templates, adding
expressions, and `navi` provided lists for the `options` and `values` pairs:

```
# Display system calls for a command (with a filter)
strace -e <EXPR_OPT>=<EXPR_SET> <SUMMARY> <QUIET> <FOLLOW_FORKS> <SYSCALL_TIMES> <SUCCESS_FAILED> <DECODE_FDS> <CMD>
;      ðŸ‘† the -e variables are new
# Display system calls for a single PID (with a filter)
strace -e <EXPR_OPT>=<EXPR_SET> <SUMMARY> <QUIET> <FOLLOW_FORKS> <SYSCALL_TIMES> <SUCCESS_FAILED> <DECODE_FDS> -p <PID>
;      ðŸ‘† the -e variables are new

$ EXPR_OPT: echo 'trace abbrev verbose raw signal read write fault inject status quiet kvm decode-fds' | tr ' ' '\n' --- --header "Expression Option (or type custom)?"
$ EXPR_SET: echo 'clock creds desc file fstat fstatfs ipc llstat memory net process pure signal stat statfs all none' | tr ' ' '\n' --- --header "Expression Set (or type custom)?"
```

Now we can interactively build a full `strace` command!

![Fig. 12](../imgs/navi_12.gif)

We want to allow the user to type something outside our list, because `strace`
supports a bunch more options, and regex, or `!` not expressions, etc. However,
`navi` doesn't have a full way to express those options so we're limited.

But this is still *leaps and bounds* better than nothing!

# Conclusion

Hopefully, this has shown how having a command builder can be a huge help.
Yes...it is work to make the cheat sheets, however there are plenty out there
ripe for copying. `navi` also has built in functionality to add public `git`
repos as cheat repositories, and have them automatically updated. I prefer to
use my own and have more control over them, but that option exists for those
that want to bootstrap making their own cheats.

There is quite a bit more `navi` can do, but this post is long enough!

Happy cheating.
